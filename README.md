<h1>Personal Portfolio Website</h1>

This is the source files for my personal website portfolio, meant to be shown as 'proof of project.' 

My personal website portfolio is a dynamic showcase of my professional and creative endeavors. 
This site is meticulously crafted using React, enhanced with the robust typing of TypeScript, and styled with the sleek, utility-first approach of TailwindCSS. 
Leveraging the power of GitHub Actions, my portfolio enjoys seamless auto-deployment to my Hostinger site, ensuring that the latest version is always live. 
This portfolio not only reflects my skills and experiences but also demonstrates my proficiency in modern web development practices and tools.
